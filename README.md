# WHAT IS SF POSER

SF Poser is a General-Purpose Animation Controller for up to 99 avatars. It can be used to create furniture from scratch and quickly without editing notecards at all. It allows on-the-fly adjustments of poses and change of animations, automatic timers, prop rezzing, NPC rezzing, RLV, expressions, and other built-in powerful utilities.
It uses the same notecard format of the wonderful PMAC system, which means that it works right away with existing PMAC furniture.
